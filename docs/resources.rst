.. _git_access:

Git Access
==========

The git repository is hosted at `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_. We have a 'master' repository located at `github.com/snakeoil/foobar <https://github.com/snakeoil/foobar>`_. This master repository only contains the main branches (master, demo, staging, release etc.)

If you don't already have a GitHub account, create a new one and add your ssh public key (you won't get access via HTTP).

Issues
======

Development is managed using `GitHub's issues <https://github.com/snakeoil/foobar/issues>`_.


IRC
===

When working on the project, developers are expected to be online on IRC at #foobar on ``irc.freenode.net``.
